The SparkFun Qwiic GPS Receiver TITAN_GPS Module provides a simple and cost effective solution for adding GPS Receiver capabilities to your project. Implementing a SparkFun Qwiic I2C interface, these sensors can be rapidly added to any project with boards that are part of the SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem.

This repository implements a Python package for the SparkFun Qwiic TITAN_GPS. This package works with Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

## Installation 

The first step to using this package is installing it on your system. The install method depends on the python platform. The following sections outline installation on Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

### Python 

#### PyPi Installation

The package is primarily installed using the `pip3` command, downloading the package from the Python Index - "PyPi". 

Note - the below instructions outline installation on a Linux-based (Raspberry Pi) system.

First, setup a virtual environment from a specific directory using venv:
```sh
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
```
You can pass any path as path/to/venv, just make sure you use the same one for all future steps. For more information on venv [click here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Next, install the qwiic package with:
```sh
path/to/venv/bin/pip3 install sparkfun-qwiic-titan_gps
```
Now you should be able to run any example or custom python scripts that have `import qwiic_titan_gps` by running e.g.:
```sh
path/to/venv/bin/python3 example_script.py
```

### MicroPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) to install mpremote on your computer.

Connect a device with MicroPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with mpremote mip.
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_titan_gps_py
```

If you would also like to install the examples for this repository, issue the following mip command as well:
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_titan_gps_py@examples
```

### CircuitPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/circup/en/latest/#installation) to install CircUp on your computer.

Ensure that you have the latest version of the SparkFun Qwiic CircuitPython bundle. 
```sh
circup bundle-add sparkfun/Qwiic_Py
```

Finally, connect a device with CircuitPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with circup.
```sh
circup install --py qwiic_titan_gps
```

If you would like to install any of the examples from this repository, issue the corresponding circup command from below. (NOTE: The below syntax assumes you are using CircUp on Windows. Linux and Mac will have different path seperators (i.e. "/" vs. "\"). See the [CircUp "example" command documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup/example-command) for more information)

```sh
circup example qwiic_titan_gps\qwiic_gps_ex1
circup example qwiic_titan_gps\qwiic_gps_ex2
```

Example Use
 ---------------
Below is a quickstart program to print readings from the TITAN_GPS.

See the examples directory for more detailed use examples and [examples/README.md](https://github.com/sparkfun/qwiic_titan_gps_py/blob/main/examples/README.md) for a summary of the available examples.

```python

from time import sleep
import sys
import qwiic_titan_gps

def run_example():

    print("SparkFun GPS Breakout - XA1110!")
    qwiicGPS = qwiic_titan_gps.QwiicTitanGps()

    if qwiicGPS.connected is False:
        print("Could not connect to to the SparkFun GPS Unit. Double check that\
              it's wired correctly.", file=sys.stderr)
        return

    qwiicGPS.begin()

    while True:
        if qwiicGPS.get_nmea_data() is True:
            print("Latitude: {}, Longitude: {}, Time: {}".format(
                qwiicGPS.gnss_messages['Latitude'],
                qwiicGPS.gnss_messages['Longitude'],
                qwiicGPS.gnss_messages['Time'])) # Time will be UTC time as a list [hh, mm, ss]

        sleep(1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        run_example()
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit) as exErr:
        print("Ending Basic Example.")
        sys.exit(0)
